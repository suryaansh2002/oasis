                There were hardly any brands in the Metaverse a year ago. It was mostly player-driven, with a few
                platform-sponsored events flaked to drive engagement. In 2021, businesses began taking cautious steps
                into this virtual world in the hopes of reaching out to an entirely new audience.Special event platforms
                were introduced with NFT-entangled objects.

                With numerous brands such as Nike, Facebook and Microsoft entering the virtual world, celebrities began
                to arrive at the Metaverse to build estates. Then, the virtual real estate corporations lined up. More
                people were enraptured as the real estate ventures built virtual properties. The Sandbox and
                Decentraland could suddenly fetch a million dollars based upon property locations. Eventually, the buzz
                around Metaverse was no longer a rumour.

                The main motivation for purchasing virtual real estate includes high returns on investment. Several
                virtual real estate projects are lined up to launch in the Metaverse. The premise is similar to that of
                purchasing an NFT: you own the digital asset stored on the blockchain and anyone can check its
                legitimacy. You can subsequently sell your virtual land if it grows in value, or can rent it out for
                events.

                After you've learned the main reasons for investing in virtual real estate, you'll must also learn to
                know how to go about doing so.

                "Land" is a token in the Sandbox Metaverse that symbolises a digital portion of the platform. Gamers
                purchasing land through Metaverse can populate the virtual land with games and assets, where they are
                tokens generated by players or brands. These investors are responsible to create and assemble
                user-generated content.

                These assets are then exchanged on various platforms as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and are mostly
                utilised to enhance one's experience. Landowners can create a variety of gaming scenarios and offer them
                to other players for free or at some price. As a result, having a venue to develop digital experiences
                is the first benefit of owning land.

                Landowners can rent out the virtual lands for people to build their own games, conduct events, and
                engage in other social activities, just like in real life.

                What if you don't have sufficient funds for the purchase? Not an issue, as mortgage finances are
                available for virtual purchases too.

                In reality, people purchase property with the help of a mortgage. This is also becoming a possibility in
                the Metaverse.

                TerraZero Technologies has put forward the first-ever Metaverse mortgage for the purchase of virtual
                property.

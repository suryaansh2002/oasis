            <p>

                Work and how it is done evolves from generation to generation. From a time when traditional professions
                were regarded as the most important and desirable to a time when technological innovation is disrupting
                the status quo, allowing for the redefinition of work and enabling access to more convenient
                possibilities.
                Starting a career, attending conferences, and creating successful projects without a physical presence
                sounded ridiculous in the past, but it's now a reality. With increasing technological advancements, it's
                clear that the Metaverse is the way of the future for everything from business to pleasure to building
                relationships. It may appear ridiculous at first, but that is true of anything humans have yet to
                comprehend.
            </p>
            <p>

                The Metaverse has the potential to alter life as we know it and to provide new and existing occupations
                for millions of people all over the world. The pandemic pushed unemployment rates to all-time highs in
                several countries, including about 7.7% in the Philippines and 5.4% in the United States, highlighting
                the necessity for a functional world outside of the one we live in. This event transformed many people's
                perceptions of virtual earning potential, particularly in the gaming industry and the rapidly growing
                Art and Fashion NFT ecosystem, where emerging creators are carving out a name for themselves in the
                virtual world.

                Top brands have kept away from the sector until now, however with increasing mainstream adoption, big
                players from all industries are starting to step in, and it will soon become the norm.
            </p>

            <p>

                People's resistance to change is a key barrier to any innovation, but I believe that in the next five to
                ten years, the Metaverse will create the most significant employment opportunities, the majority of
                which are currently non-existent or undervalued. Asides from technical skills, it will require a lot of
                creativity and imagination power.

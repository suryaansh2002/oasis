            <p>

                Roblox’s vision for the metaverse is to create a platform for immersive co-experiences, where people can
                come together within millions of 3D experiences to learn, work, play, create, and socialize. Fostering a
                rich community built on shared experiences is central to this vision and a driving force for Roblox’s
                path forward. As we build an engaging and civil community where people form real connections, we are
                envisioning the future of communication both in the metaverse and beyond.

                At Roblox, we believe that the metaverse is for everyone, and it follows that the communication
                capabilities we create must also be for everyone. Different users will have different communication
                needs based on their context. Our vision for communication has the potential to transcend digital
                boundaries; therefore we are being thoughtful and deliberate about making communication safe as we
                realize this vision.

                Three fundamental principles guide our approach to the future of communication on Roblox. First,
                communication capabilities must be rooted in the ways we communicate in the real world, especially when
                in an immersive 3D experience. For example, we raise our voice to reach someone far away, we whisper
                when we wish to be discreet, we alter our communication style depending on if we are alone or with
                others, and we use gestures and facial expressions to add nuance and emotion to our words.
            </p>
            <p>

                Virtual communication will also be subject to the same forms of natural moderation that exist in the
                real world. To continue with our restaurant example, if you yell at someone during that public meal,
                it’s likely that people around you will ask you to quiet down or, depending on how offensive you are,
                you’ll be asked to leave. There will be similar consequences on Roblox: our community will be able to
                self-regulate and flag a user that is not adhering to community standards, and that user may be removed
                from an experience or lose speaking privileges. The metaverse is an extension and augmentation of
                reality and the standards for civility that we hold ourselves to in the real world must carry over to
                the digital.

                These principles have led to today’s release of Spatial Voice as an invitation-only beta to selected
                members of our developer community. We hope to collaborate with our community to evolve Spatial Voice to
                make it realistic, safe, and easy for developers to integrate across all Roblox experiences. With
                Spatial Voice, Roblox creators will begin to test developing experiences where conversations can happen
                in a realistic way, mirroring how we listen and respond to the world around us each day.

                As the metaverse continues to grow and bring people together in new, unexpected, and exciting ways,
                Roblox anticipates that communication will have an increasingly integral role. We are embarking on this
                long-term vision for the future of communication because it allows us to be measured and thoughtful in
                our approach. This will enable us to introduce capabilities that serve the needs of the Roblox
                community, uphold our standards for digital civility, and contain the necessary safeguards to protect
                users of all ages. We believe that a mix of the right communication features and safety measures will
                further elevate the shared experiences of the metaverse, and we are eager to partner with our community
                to bring these features to life.

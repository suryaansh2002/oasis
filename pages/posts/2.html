            <p>

                Traci and Dave Gagnon met in the cloud, so it only made sense that their wedding took place in it. On
                Labor Day weekend, the couple — or rather, their digital avatars — held a ceremony staged by Virbela, a
                company that builds virtual environments for work, learning and events.
            </p>
            <p>

                Traci Gagnon’s avatar was walked down the aisle by the avatar of her close friend. Dave Gagnon’s avatar
                watched as his buddy’s avatar ambled up to the stage and delivered a toast. And 7-year-old twin avatars
                (the ring bearer and flower girl) danced at the reception.

                How the immersive virtual world known as the metaverse, which few of us understand, will change the
                traditional wedding is, at the moment, anyone’s guess. But the possibilities of having an event
                unfettered by the bounds of reality are interesting enough to consider.

                Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, technology is already being incorporated into ceremonies more than
                ever. Zoom weddings have taken place, and some in-person ceremonies now feature a livestream component
                for guests who cannot be there. Last year, a couple whose wedding was canceled because of the pandemic
                staged a (nonlegal) ceremony within Animal Crossing, a popular video game.

                Like a ceremony within a video game, any weddings that occur solely in the metaverse are currently not
                legal. Still, the metaverse will take these virtual celebrations much, much further, experts say, and
                offer almost boundless possibilities to couples.

                “There’s no limitations,” said Sandy Hammer, a founder of Allseated, which creates digital planning
                tools for weddings. The company is investing in the metaverse by creating virtual versions of real-world
                event spaces like the Plaza Hotel in New York. “If you really want to do something different, in the
                metaverse you might as well let your creativity go wild.”

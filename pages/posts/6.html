                Have you ever dreamed of having Superpowers? Imagine having the power to teleport wherever you like,
                whenever you like. You would be able to travel the world, attend shows of your favorite artists, meet
                your friends and family at your convenience. Sounds impossible, doesn’t it?
            </p>

                We have all watched the movie ‘Avatar’ in which the humans trying to colonize a planet ‘Pandora’, face
                resistance from a local tribe. The humans then with the help of technology, remotely control a Pandorian
                body to interact with the tribe.
                Now imagine yourself controlling a digital character in a virtual world wherein you are free to do
                whatever you want and whenever you want. This is what the concept of Metaverse is.

                A few decades ago we used to write and post letters to communicate with people living away from us. Then
                came the invention of phones which could be used to talk to people over large distances without any
                hassle. This experience of communication was then taken to a whole new level of realness with the
                implementation of the Internet. This gave us features such as Video Calls wherein we can see and talk to
                anyone we want from the comfort of our homes. This gives us a pretty realistic experience of interacting
                with someone.
                Now taking this a step further imagine yourself entering a virtual room in which you can interact with
                people living across the globe as if they are sitting in the same room with you. You can talk, see and
                feel their physical presence.
                With the development of such technology not only does the experience and convenience of interacting
                improve but also the overall quality of life does.
